    <div id="start" class="introduction">
       <p>A loving universe is constantly taking care of us.
         <p><span class="important">Universe is able to fulfill all our desires and dreams, and to help us in the implementation of our plans. The main thing is that we should say about it. </span></p>
      <p>While concentrating on something, we send a signal to the Universe, it's received by it, and we get into our life what we thought about.Taking our signals, sent through thoughts, the Universe fulfills our order in the form we wanted.</p>
      <p>The universe cannot determine what is good and what is bad for human. She sends
him what he thinks about.</p>
      <p>Each person can remember the moments of his life, when he began to think about some question and the answer came to him in the form of thoughts, an answer on TV, an article in a newspaper, a call from a friend, an accidentally heard conversation. So the universe gives us the answers to our questions and prompts solutions.</p>
      <p>In the famous Russian fairytale Vasilisa the Wise says to Ivan - Tsarevich: “The morning is wiser than the evening.” Thinking about something before bedtime, we send our question to the Universe, and the next morning we always get an answer.</p>
      <p>One thing we must always remember: gratitude and thank the Universe for all that it gives. Even if it seems bad to us. After all, we ourselves pulled it into our lives. So, our task is to learn to think positively.</p>
      <p>You need to thank with love and radiate this love.</p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="important">How to interact with the Universe?<span></p>

    <div id="p1" class="part ask">
      <img id="img_left" src="http://alishakohli.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Divine-inspiration-life-girl-sun.jpg" alt="ask">
      <h2 id="part1">The first secret is to ask</h2>
      <p>Our desire for the universe - the law. We can ask it everything we want. And it will do everything for us. The universe is abundant.</p>
      <p>You just need to know exactly what you need. Uncertainty of desire or dream gives uncertainty to the Universe. Desires must be specific.</p>
      <p>You need to think very well about what you want in life, and what it should be to make you feel like a happy person. Imagine your life with all details and in great accuracy.</p>
      <p>This is a very crucial moment. Only having clearly realized, having imagined, felt, you can send your request to the Universe.</p>
      <p>It is enough to do it once. So, as if we made an order of goods in the catalog. We opened the catalog, chose the product, placed an order and are waiting for its delivery.</p>
      <p>Having determined what we need, we inform the Universe about it and look forward to the fulfillment of our dreams or help in achieving goals.</p>
      <p>It is best to write down your desires or goals. Records must be made in the present tense. This should be a detailed description of the desired life. It is better to make such records on the growing moon, on Friday. You need to write on a beautiful, better red, sheet of paper or in a beautiful notebook, preferably the same color.</p>
      
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="p2" class="part believe">
      <h2 id="part2">The second secret is to believe</h2>
      <img id="img_right" src="https://talking2mymoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/believe.jpg" alt="beleive">
      <p>If a person does not dare to dream, if he believes that he is not worthy of all the best, that only the chosen people can get the best in life, that just falls on their head, and is achieved by hard work and is not easy, then he will remain where he is, even if he is not quite happy with it.</p>
      <p>Often a person does not even try to desire just because he does not believe in the fulfillment of his wishes.</p>
      <p>Unchangable belief that the desired ones will be fulfilled, makes it a reality. Already at that moment when the request was sent to the Universe, we must not immediately doubt the execution of our order, relax and live as if the wish had already been fulfilled.</p>
      <p>To get what you want, you need to believe that it already exists at the moment, that you already receive it. It is necessary to create a feeling of receiving in oneself, in order to radiate the appropriate frequency of receiving and thereby attract people, circumstances, events to fulfill the goals.</p>
      <p>It's must to imagine the desired. Do not be afraid to dream. These fantasies are known only to human and the Universe. Plunge into fantasy, keep it in your head and live in it as a matter of fact.</p>
      <p>No need to ask questions about how desire will be fulfilled. The Universe itself organizes everything. But an attempt to understand how the realization of the desired occurs indicates about lack of faith that the desirable already exists and the frequency of lack of faith is emitted.</p>
      <p>Appearing disappointments or doubts should be replaced by an unshakable faith in the help of the universe and the fulfillment of desires.</p>
      
    </div>
    
    
    
    <div id="p3" class="part accept">
    <h2 id="part3">The third secret - to accept</h2>
    <img id="img_left" src="https://booknvolume.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dreams-come-true-2.jpg" alt="accept">  
      <p>Having sent a request to the Universe, being in a state of complete confidence that everything will be fulfilled, you must always be in excellent mood, a feeling of happiness and joy. It is necessary to feel as if the desired has already come.</p>
      <p>It is necessary not only to believe with the mind, but also to support faith with feelings. A positive attitude attracts only the good and the desired.</p>
      <p>If you only believe and do not support faith with feelings, then there will not be enough force to fulfill the desired.</p>
      <p>Actions taken on the way to the realization of desire must be filled with inspiration and carried out with joy.</p>
      <p>Carrying out actions on the way to your goal, you need to trust your intuition, do not delay, do not hesitate and have no doubts.</p>
      <p>Wanting something, we are turning into a magnet that attracts the desired. If you need money - you will attract money, you need people - you will attract the right people. Things we want enter our physical reality through the Law of Attraction</p>
      <p>How long will it take to fulfill desires?</p>
      <p>Einstein proved that time is an illusion. Quantum physicists say that everything passes at the same time. And what we want is already there.</p>
      <p>Fulfillment of desires depends only on how quickly we attain faith and the feeling "I already have it." The universe does not take time to execute desires, but the delay is due to our faith and our sensations.</p>
      <p><span class="important">Ask the Universe for all that you need, firmly believe in the fulfillment of desire, gladly accept what you want in your life. May your life be happy and successful!</span></p>
